## Steps
Here are the steps to setup and debug this project

- In Git - Clone the online-piano repository.
- Open VS Code and do "Open Folder" for the online-piano directory that was created when cloning the repo
- In VS Code click the Run & Debug (Triangle shaped icon on left side of screen) or hit CTRL-SHIFT-D
- At top of Debug pane, select "Debug Next.js (Client + Server)" in the dropdown then click green 
  triangle on the left
- This will open up Chrome and will start installing the NodeJS packages, builds the project, and starts 
  the development server  NOTE: The debug Client uses the Chrome web browser.  This setting can be changed in the .vscode\launch.json file
- To set breakpoints, open the file src\page.tsx and click in the margin left of line number 10 to 
  set a breakpoint on the page.  After setting the breakpoint refresh the page in Chrome.  Now in VSCode, 
  it will hit your breakpoint and you can step through/over your code will seeing the variables.  You 
  can also evaluate the variables while running and do watches on the variables
- To stop the debugging, click the red square in center of the screen twice.  Once for the server and 
  once for client




## Optional manual command line tools

You can install the NodeJS modules directly by running the following command in the online-piano directory:

```console
foo@bar:online-piano$ npm install
```


You can also build the project manually with the following command:

```console
foo@bar:online-piano$ npx next build
```


You can also run the development live update server with the following command:

```console
foo@bar:online-piano$ npx next dev
```


INFO: The command used to build the scaffolding Next.js project was the following:

```console
foo@bar:~$ npx create-next-app@latest
```


Older method for running the server.  It is better to use above npx next dev instead but leaving this here:

```console
foo@bar:online-piano$ npm start
```








Below was generated by building the Next.js project with the "npx create-next-app@latest" command.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
